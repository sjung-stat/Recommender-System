Recommender System
================

> Understanding customers' preferences and building a system to recommend the right products

### Introduction

Have you ever spent hours watching dozens of videos on YouTube without realizing that it's way past your bedtime, when you were going to watch just one video? Or have you purchased something recommended by Amazon that goes well with the one that you purchased before on Amazon?

It happened because of this technique called "recommender system". [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) defines the technique as follows; "a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item."

In other words, this technique enables online businesses to understand their customers' preferences based on their data and recommend their products or services according to their personal tastes. Since they offer personalized recommendations, it arises a consumers' interest enough to result in a purchase. [This article](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application_development/9781785282584/3/ch03lvl1sec18/importance-of-recommender-systems-in-e-commerce) summarizes the importance of recommender systems as follows:

1. Browsers into buyers
2. Cross-sell
3. Loyalty


Likewise, recommender system brings great benefits to the businesses. Therefore, majority of online businesses are trying to build more accurate recommender systems.
